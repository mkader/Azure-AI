* Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to predict numeric values.
* use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning designer to create regression models by using a drag and drop visual interface, without needing to write any code.

# Identify regression ML scenarios
1. Regression is a form of ML used to understand the relationships between variables to predict a desired outcome. 
2. Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. 
    1. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage ...) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.
3. Train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.
4. Scenarios for regression machine learning models: Using characteristics of
    1. houses, such as square footage and number of rooms, to predict home prices.
    2. farm conditions, such as weather and soil quality, to predict crop yield.
    3. a past campaign, such as advertising logs, to predict future advertisement clicks.

# What is Azure Machine Learning designer?
1. In Azure M studio, there are several ways to author regression ML models. 
2. <b>One way is to use a visual interface called designer</b> that you can use to train, test, and deploy machine learning models.The drag-and-drop interface makes use of clearly defined inputs and outputs that can be shared, reused, and version controlled.

3. Each designer project, known as a <b>pipeline</b>, has a left panel for navigation and a canvas on your right hand side. To use designer, identify the building blocks, or components, needed for your model, place and connect them on your canvas, and run a machine learning job.

4. <b>Pipelines</b> let you organize, manage, and reuse complex ML workflows across projects and users. A pipeline starts with the dataset from which you want to train the model. Each time you run a pipeline, the configuration of the pipeline and its results are stored in your workspace as a pipeline job.

5. <b>Components</b> - encapsulates one step in a ML pipeline. You can think of a component as a programming function and as a building block for Azure ML pipelines. In a pipeline project, you can access data assets and components from the left panel's Asset Library tab.

6. <b>Datasets</b>. create data assets on the Data page from local files, a datastore, web files, and Open Datasets. These data assets will appear along with standard sample datasets in designer's Asset Library. 

7. <b>Azure Machine Learning Jobs</b> - job executes a task against a specified compute target. Jobs enable systematic tracking for your ML experimentation and workflows. Once a job is created, Azure ML maintains a run record for the job. All of your jobs' run records can be viewed in Azure ML studio.

    1. In your designer project, you can access the status of a pipeline job using the Submitted jobs tab on the left pane.

    2. You can find all the jobs you have run in a workspace on the Jobs page.
