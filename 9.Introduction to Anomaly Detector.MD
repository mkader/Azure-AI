# Introduction to Anomaly Detector
* Discover the services available on Azure to detect anomalies in your time-series, or real-time data.
* Anomaly detection is an AI technique used to determine whether values in a series are within expected parameters.
* There are many scenarios where anomaly detection is helpful. For example, a smart HVAC system might use anomaly detection to monitor temperatures in a building and raise an alert if the temperature goes above or below the expected value for a given period of time.
* Other scenarios include:
    1. monitoring blood pressure
    2. evaluating mean time between failures for hardware products
    3. comparing month-over-month expenses for product costs

# What is Anomaly Detector?
* Anomalies are values that are outside the expected values or range of values.

* In the graphic depicting the time series data, there is a light shaded area that indicates the boundary, or sensitivity range. The solid blue line is used to indicate the measured values. When a measured value is outside of the shaded boundary, an orange dot is used to indicate the value is considered an anomaly. The sensitivity boundary is a parameter that you can specify when calling the service. It allows you to adjust that boundary settings to tweak the results.
* Anomaly detection is considered the act of identifying events, or observations, that differ in a significant way from the rest of the data being evaluated. Accurate anomaly detection leads to prompt troubleshooting, which helps to avoid revenue loss and maintain brand reputation.

# Azure's Anomaly Detector service
* Anomaly Detector is a part of the Decision Services category within Azure Cognitive Services. It is a cloud-based service that enables you to monitor time series data, and to detect anomalies in that data. It does not require you to know ML. The service uses the concept of a "one parameter" strategy. The main parameter you need to customize is “Sensitivity”, which is from 1 to 99 to adjust the outcome to fit the scenario. The service can detect anomalies in historical time series data and also in real-time data such as streaming input from IoT devices, sensors, or other streaming input sources.
