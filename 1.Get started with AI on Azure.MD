# What is AI?
* AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:
  * ML - the foundation for an AI system, "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
  * Anomaly detection - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
  * Computer vision - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
  * Natural language processing - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
  * Knowledge mining - The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

# Understand ML
* A real-world example of how ML can be used to solve a difficult problem.
  * Sustainable farming techniques to maximize food production while protecting a fragile environment. 
  * An agricultural technology company, uses sensors, data, and ML to help farmers make informed decisions related to weather, soil, and plant conditions.

* How ML works
  * So how do machines learn? from data. We create huge volumes of data from our everyday lives from homes, cars, cities,.. through like messages, emails, posts, photos, videos
  * Data scientists can use all of that data to train ML models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.
  * For example, to identify and catalog different species of wildflower using a phone app. 
    1. Collect data on wildflower samples,  then labels the samples with the correct species.
    2. The labeled data is processed using an algorithm that finds relationships between the features of the samples and the labeled species.
    3. The results of the algorithm are encapsulated in a model. When new samples are found, the model can identify the correct species label.

* ML in MS Azure
  1. Automated ML -	This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective ML model from data.
  2. Azure ML designer	- A graphical interface enabling no-code development of ML solutions.
  3. Data and compute management - 	Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional can use to run data experiment code at scale.
  4. Pipelines	- Professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.

# Understand anomaly detection
* A software system to monitor credit card transactions and detect unusual usage patterns that might indicate fraud. 
* An application that tracks activity in an automated production line and identifies failures. 
* A racing car telemetry system that uses sensors to proactively warn engineers about potential mechanical failures before they happen.

* These kinds of scenario can be addressed by using <b>anomaly detection</b> - a ML based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.

* How anomaly detection might help in the racing car scenario.
 1. Sensors in the car collect telemetry, such as engine revolutions, brake temperature, and so on.
 2. An anomaly detection model is trained to understand expected fluctuations in the telemetry measurements over time.
 3. If a measurement occurs outside of the normal expected range, the model reports an anomaly that can be used to alert the race engineer to call the driver in for a pit stop to fix the issue before it forces retirement from the race.
 
 * Anomaly detection in MS Azure provides an API that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/

# Understand computer vision
* Computer Vision is an area of AI that deals with visual processing. 
* The Seeing AI app designed for the blind and low vision community to describe nearby people, text and objects. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/seeing-ai?rtc=1
* Computer Vision models and capabilities are based on ML models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images. The common computer vision tasks:
1. Image classification (IC)	- a ML model to classify images based on their contents. For example, a traffic monitoring solution (TMS) use an IC model to classify images based on the type of vehicle (taxis, buses, cyclists, ...)
2. Object detection	- ML models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a TMS might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of vehicle. ![](1.object_detection.png)
3. Semantic segmentation	- is an advanced ML technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a TMS might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors. ![](2.semantic-segmentation.png)
4. Image analysis - ML models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image. the caption "A person with a dog on a street" ![](3.image-analysis.png)
5. Face detection - is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their facial features. ![](4.face-analysis.png)
6. Optical character recognition (OCR)	- is a technique used to detect and read text in images. ![](5.ocr.png)

* Computer vision services in MS Azure. MS Azure provides the following cognitive services to help you create computer vision solutions:
1. Computer Vision	- to analyze images and video, and extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
2. Custom Vision	 - to train custom image classification and object detection models using your own images.
3. Face	 - to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
4. Form Recognizer - to extract information from scanned forms and invoices.
