* With AI, enabling incredible advances in health care, financial management, environmental protection, and other areas to make a better world for 
everyone.

# What is AI?
* AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:
  * ML - the foundation for an AI system, "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
  * Anomaly detection - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
  * Computer vision - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
  * Natural language processing - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
  * Knowledge mining - The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

# Understand ML

* A real-world example of how ML can be used to solve a difficult problem.
  * Sustainable farming techniques to maximize food production while protecting a fragile environment. 
  * An agricultural technology company, uses sensors, data, and ML to help farmers make informed decisions related to weather, soil, and plant conditions.

* How ML works
  * So how do machines learn? from data. We create huge volumes of data from our everyday lives from homes, cars, cities,.. through like messages, emails, posts, photos, videos
  * Data scientists can use all of that data to train ML models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.
  * For example, to identify and catalog different species of wildflower using a phone app. 
    1. Collect data on wildflower samples,  then labels the samples with the correct species.
    2. The labeled data is processed using an algorithm that finds relationships between the features of the samples and the labeled species.
    3. The results of the algorithm are encapsulated in a model. When new samples are found, the model can identify the correct species label.

* ML in Microsoft Azure
  1. Automated ML -	This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective ML model from data.
  2. Azure ML designer	- A graphical interface enabling no-code development of ML solutions.
  3. Data and compute management - 	Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional can use to run data experiment code at scale.
  4. Pipelines	- Professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.
