# Create and consume Cognitive Services
* Azure Cognitive Services encapsulate AI capabilities. 
* Cognitive services includes a wide range of individual AI services across multiple categories, as shown in the following table.
  ``` mark
  Language	Speech	Vision	Decision
  Language	Speech	Computer Vision	Anomaly Detector
  Translator		Custom Vision	Content Moderator
  Face	Personalizer
  ```
* use Cognitive Services to build your own AI solutions, and they also underpin Azure Applied AI Services that provide out-of-the-box solutions for common AI scenarios. Applied AI Services include:
    1. Azure Form Recognizer - an optical character recognition (OCR) solution that can extract semantic meaning from forms, such as invoices, receipts, and others.
    2. Azure Metrics Advisor - A service built on the Anomaly Detector cognitive service that simplifies real-time monitoring and response to critical metrics.
    3. Azure Video Analyzer for Media - A comprehensive video analysts solution build on the Video Indexer cognitive service.
    4. Azure Immersive Reader - A reading solution that supports people of all ages and abilities.
    5. Azure Bot Service - A cloud service for delivering conversational AI solutions, or bots.
    6. Azure Cognitive Search - A cloud-scale search solution that uses cognitive services to extract insights from data and documents.

# Provision a cognitive services resource
* Multi-service resource - supports multiple different cognitive services. For example, you could create a single resource that enables you to use the Language, Computer Vision, Speech, and other services. Single endpoint, credentials, billing for all services.

* Single-service resource - individually, for example by creating discrete Language and Computer Vision resources. Separate endpoints , credentials, billing for each service.

* Training and prediction resources - separate resources for model training and prediction. manage billing for training custom models separately

* Use a REST API & SDK

# Exercise - Use cognitive services

# Quiz 
1. How are client applications typically granted access to a cognitive services endpoint?
* [x] The application must specify a valid subscription key * [ ] The user of the application must enter a user name and password associated with the Azure subscription.
* [ ] Access to cognitive services is granted to anonymous users by default.

2. In which format are message exchanged between a client app and a cognitive services resource when using a REST API?
* [ ] XML
* [x] JSON
* [ ] HTML
