# Fundamentals of ML

# What is ML?
* ML is a technique that uses mathematics and statistics to create a model that can <b>predict unknown values</b>.
* For example, Cycle rental company could use historic data to train a model that predicts daily rental demand in order to make sure sufficient staff and cycles are available.
* To do this, create a ML model that takes information about a specific day (the day of week, weather, ...) as an input (x), the number of rentals for that day is the label (y), and predicts the expected number of rentals as an output.The function (f) that calculates the number of rentals based on the information about the day is encapsulated in a machine learning model. f(x) = y (ML models in mathematical terms).
* Let's explore the steps involved in training and inferencing.

    1. <b>The training data</b> consists of past observations. It contains, <b>the observed attributes or features value (x)</b> and <b>the known value (y)</b> to train a model to predict <b>(known as the label)</b>.
        1. an observation consists of multiple feature values, so x is actually a vector (an array with multiple values), like this: [x1,x2,x3,...].
        1. To make this clearer from exmaple:
            1. Ice cream sales : predict the number of ice cream sales based on the weather. The weather (x), and the number of ice creams sold on each day (y).
            1. Medical : to predict whether or not a patient is at risk of diabetes based on their clinical measurements. The patient's measurements (x)) and the likelihood of diabetes (y for example, 1 for at risk, 0 for not at risk).
            1. Antarctic research : to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical attributes. The key measurements (x) of the penguin (length of its flippers, width of its bill, and so on) and the species (y) (for example, 0 for Adelie, 1 for Gentoo, or 2 for Chinstrap).
    1. <b>An algorithm</b> is applied to the data to try to determine a relationship between the features and the label, and generalize that relationship as a calculation that can be performed on x to calculate y. 
    1. <b>The result of the algorithm</b> is a model that encapsulates : y = f(x)
    1. <b>Now that the training phase</b> is complete, the trained model can be used for inferencing.

* <b>Types of ML</b> : supervised ML and unsupervised ML

    1. <b>Supervised ML</b> in which the training data includes both feature values and known label values. Supervised ML is used to train models by determining a relationship between the features and labels in past observations, so that unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.
        1. <b>Regression</b> in which the label predicted by the model is a numeric value. For example:
            1. <b>The number of ice creams sold</b> on a given day, based on the temperature, rainfall, and windspeed.
            1. <b>The selling price of a property/b> based on its size in square feet, the number of bedrooms it contains, and socio-economic metrics for its location.
            1. <b>The fuel efficiency (in miles-per-gallon) of a car</b> based on its engine size, weight, width, height, and length.
        2. <b>Classification</b> in which the label represents a categorization, or class. There are two common classification scenarios.
            1. <b>Binary classification</b> - the model predicts a binary true/false or positive/negative prediction for a single possible class. For example:
                1. <b>Whether a patient is at risk</b> for diabetes based on clinical metrics like weight, age, blood glucose level, and so on.
                1. <b>Whether a bank customer will default</b> on a loan based on income, credit history, age, and other factors.
                1. <b>Whether a mailing list customer will respond</b> positively to a marketing offer based on demographic attributes and past purchases.
            1. <b>Multiclass classification</b> extends binary classification to predict a label that represents one of multiple possible classes. For example,
                1. The species of a penguin (Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap) based on its physical measurements.
                    1. A penguin can't be both a Gentoo and an Adelie. Use some algorithms to train multilabel classification models, in which there may be more than one valid label for a single observation.
                1. The genre of a movie (comedy, horror, romance, adventure, or science fiction) based on its cast, director, and budget.
                    1. a movie could potentially be categorized as both science fiction and comedy.
    2. <b>Unsupervised ML</b> involves training models using data that consists only of feature values <b>without any known labels</b>. Unsupervised ML algorithms determine relationships between the features of the observations in the training data.
        1. <b>Clustering</b> algorithm identifies similarities between observations based on their features, and groups them into discrete clusters. For example:
            1. Group similar flowers based on their size, number of leaves, and number of petals.
            1. Identify groups of similar customers based on demographic attributes and purchasing behavior.
