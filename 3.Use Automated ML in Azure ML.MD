# What is machine learning?
* ML is a technique that uses mathematics and statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values.
* For example, Cycle rental company could use historic data to train a model that predicts daily rental demand in order to make sure sufficient staff and cycles are available.
* To do this, create a ML model that takes information about a specific day (the day of week, weather, ...) as an input (x), the number of rentals for that day is the label (y), and predicts the expected number of rentals as an output.The function (f) that calculates the number of rentals based on the information about the day is encapsulated in a machine learning model. f(x) = y

* <b>Types of ML</b> : supervised and unsupervised ML
    1. <b>The supervised ML</b> approach requires you to start with a dataset with known label values. Two types of supervised ML tasks include regression and classification.
        1. <b>Regression</b>: used to predict a continuous value; like a price, a sales total, or some other measure.
        2. <b>Classification</b>: used to determine a class label; an example of a binary class label is whether a patient has diabetes or not; an example of multi-class labels is classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.
    2. <b>The unsupervised ML</b> approach starts with a dataset without known label values. One type of unsupervised ML task is clustering.
        1. <b>Clustering:</b> used to determine labels by grouping similar information into label groups; like grouping measurements from birds into species.

# What is Azure Machine Learning?
* Training and deploying an effective ML model involves a lot of work, much of it time-consuming and resource-intensive. 
* Azure ML is a cloud-based service that helps simplify some of the tasks it takes to prepare data, train a model, and deploy a predictive service.

# Azure Machine Learning workspace
* Crreate a workspace resource. 
* Develop solutions with the Azure ML service either with developer tools or the Azure ML studio web portal.
* <b>Azure Machine Learning studio</b> - is a web portal for ML solutions in Azure. 
        ![](img/3/1.studio-home.png)

# Azure Machine Learning compute
* At its core, Azure ML is a service for training and managing ML models, for which you need compute on which to run the training process.
* Compute targets are cloud-based resources on which you can run model training and data exploration processes.
* In Azure Machine Learning studio, you can manage the compute targets for your data science activities. 4 compute resource you can create:
    1. <b>Compute Instances</b>: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
    2. <b>Compute Clusters</b>: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
    3. <b>Inference Clusters</b>: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
    4. <b>Attached Compute</b>: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.

# What is Azure Automated Machine Learning?
* Azure ML includes an automated ML capability that automatically tries multiple pre-processing techniques and model-training algorithms in parallel. These automated capabilities use the power of cloud compute to find the best performing supervised ML model for your data.

* create an automated machine learning job in Azure Machine Learning studio.
    ![](img/3/2.automated-machine-learning-portal.png)

* In Azure ML, operations that you run are called <b>jobs</b>. You can configure multiple settings for your job before starting an automated ML run. The run configuration provides the information needed to specify your training script, compute target, and Azure ML environment in your run configuration and run a training job.
    ![](img/3/3.start-job-machine-learning-studio.png)

# Understand the AutoML process

* ## The steps in a machine learning process as:
    1. <b>Prepare data</b>: Identify the features and label in a dataset. Pre-process, or clean and transform, the data as needed.
    2. <b>Train model</b>: Split the data into two groups, <b>a training and a validation set</b>. 
        1. Train a machine learning model using the training data set. 
        2. Test the machine learning model for performance using the validation data set.
    3. <b>Evaluate performance</b>: Compare how close the model's predictions are to the known labels.
    4. <b>Deploy a predictive service</b>: After you train a ML model, deploy the model as an application on a server so that others can use it.

* These are the same steps in the automated ML process with Azure ML
    1. <b>Prepare data</b> - ML models must be trained with existing data. In Azure ML, data for model training and other operations is usually encapsulated in an object called a <b>data asset</b>. You can create your own data asset in Azure Machine Learning studio.
        ![](img/3/4.auto-machine-learning-select-data.png)
    2. <b>Train model</b> - The automated ML capability in Azure ML supports supervised ML models, means models for which the training data includes known label values. You can use automated ML to train models for:
        1. <b>Classification</b> (predicting categories or classes)
        2. <b>Regression</b> (predicting numeric values)
        3. <b>Time series forecasting</b> (predicting numeric values at a future point in time)

* In Automated Machine Learning you can select from several types of tasks:
    ![](img/3/5.choose-task-settings.png)

* In Automated ML, select configurations for the primary metric, type of model used for training, exit criteria, and concurrency limits.
    ![](img/3/6.machine-learning-run-configurations.png)

* AutoML will split data into a training set and a validation set. You can configure the details in the settings before you run the job.
    ![](img/3/7.training-validation.png)

* <b>Evaluate performance</b> - After the job has finished you can review the best performing model. Thus the "best" model the job generated might not be the best possible model, just the best one found within the time allowed for this exercise.

    * The best model is identified based on the evaluation metric you specified, Normalized root mean squared error.

    * A technique called <b>cross-validation</b> is used to calculate the evaluation metric. After the model is trained using a portion of the data, the remaining portion is used to iteratively test, or cross-validate, the trained model. The metric is calculated by comparing the predicted value from the test with the actual known value, or label.

    * <b>The difference between the predicted and actual value, known as the residuals</b>, indicates the amount of error in the model. 
    * The <b>performance metric root mean squared error (RMSE)</b>, is calculated by squaring the errors across all of the test cases, finding the mean of these squares, and then taking the square root. What all of this means is that smaller this value is, the more accurate the model's predictions. 
    * <b>The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE)</b> standardizes the RMSE metric so it can be used for comparison between models which have variables on different scales.

    * <n>The Residual Histogram</b> shows the frequency of residual value ranges. Residuals represent variance between predicted and true values that can't be explained by the model, in other words, errors. You should hope to see the most frequently occurring residual values clustered around zero. You want small errors with fewer errors at the extreme ends of the scale.
        ![](img/3/8.residual-histogram.png)

    * <b>The Predicted vs. True chart</b> should show a diagonal trend in which the predicted value correlates closely to the true value. The dotted line shows how a perfect model should perform. The closer the line of your model's average predicted value is to the dotted line, the better its performance. A histogram below the line chart shows the distribution of true values.<br/>
        ![](img/3/9.predicted-vs-true.png)

    * After you've used automated ML to train some models, you can deploy the best performing model as a service for client applications to use.

* <b>Deploy a predictive service</b> - In Azure ML, you can deploy a service as an Azure Container Instances (ACI) or to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. For production scenarios, an AKS deployment is recommended, for which you must create an inference cluster compute target.
